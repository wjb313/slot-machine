### Good day to you!

This project is meant to practice html, css, and js skills by creating a simple slot machine.

Assignment: Create a rudimentary slot machine. When the user presses a button, we generate 3 random numbers from 1 to 9 and show them in the page. If all numbers are equal, the user wins. Show some gratifying message when this happens, then offer to restart the game.
